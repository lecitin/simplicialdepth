\title{Simplicial Depth}
\usage{
simplicialdepth(X, x = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of size \eqn{n \times d} containing the sample 
points, where each row is an observation and each column is a coordinate. 
The dimension \eqn{d} must be either 2 or 3.}

\item{x}{Optional. A query point or set of points:
\itemize{
  \item If `NULL` (default):
    \itemize{
      \item In 2D, computes the simplicial depth for each point in `X` 
      with respect to the rest of the sample.
      \item In 3D, computes the simplicial depth for each point in `X`, 
      provided there are at least 5 sample points. If `n \le 4`, returns 
      a zero vector of length `n`.
    }
  \item If a numeric vector of length \eqn{d}, computes the depth of this 
    single point with respect to `X`.
  \item If a numeric matrix with \eqn{d} columns, computes the depth of 
    each row of `x` with respect to `X`.
}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of depths (one per query point or per row of `X`), 
depending on the input.
}
\description{
Computes the simplicial depth for 2D or 3D data, either for all points in a 
sample or for user-specified query points.
}
\details{
In both 2D and 3D, depths are normalized by the corresponding binomial 
coefficients:
\itemize{
  \item In 2D: division by \eqn{choose(n-1, 3)} or \eqn{choose(n, 3)} 
  depending on whether depths are computed for sample points or query points.
  \item In 3D: division by \eqn{choose(n-1, 4)} or \eqn{choose(n, 4)}. 
}
}
\examples{
# Simulate some 2D data
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(20), ncol = 2)

# Depths for each point in X
simplicialdepth(X)

# Depth for a single query point
simplicialdepth(X, c(0,0))

# Depths for multiple query points
Y <- matrix(rnorm(6), ncol = 2)
simplicialdepth(X, Y)

# Simulate some 3D data
X3 <- matrix(rnorm(30), ncol = 3)
simplicialdepth(X3)  # depths for each point in X3
