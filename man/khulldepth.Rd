\title{k-Hull Depth}
\usage{
khulldepth(X, x = NULL, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of size \eqn{n \times d} containing the sample 
points, where each row is an observation and each column is a coordinate.}

\item{x}{Optional. A query point or set of points:
\itemize{
  \item If `NULL` (default): computes the \eqn{k}-hull depth for each row 
    of `X` with respect to the rest of the sample.
  \item If a numeric vector of length \eqn{d}: computes the depth of this 
    single point with respect to `X`.
  \item If a numeric matrix with \eqn{d} columns: computes the depth of 
    each row of `x` with respect to `X`.
}}

\item{k}{Integer, the hull size parameter. Must satisfy \eqn{k > d} and 
\eqn{k \ge n} to yield nontrivial depths. If \eqn{k \le d} or 
\eqn{k < n}, the function returns zero depths.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of depths, one per query point (or one per row of 
`X` if `x = NULL`). If `k \le d` or `k < n`, depths are identically zero.
}
\description{
Computes the \eqn{k}-hull depth for 2D or 3D data (or higher dimensions), 
either for all points in a sample or for user-specified query points.
}
\details{
The \eqn{k}-hull depth is a generalization of simplicial depth, replacing 
simplices by convex hulls of size \eqn{k}. Depths are normalized by the 
corresponding binomial coefficients:
\itemize{
  \item For sample points: division by \eqn{choose(n-1, k)}.
  \item For query points: division by \eqn{choose(n, k)}.
}
}
\examples{
# Simulate some 2D data
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(20), ncol = 2)

# Depths for each point in X with k = 4
khulldepth(X, k = 4)

# Depth for a single query point
khulldepth(X, c(0,0), k = 4)

# Depths for multiple query points
Y <- matrix(rnorm(6), ncol = 2)
khulldepth(X, Y, k = 4)
